# Fit Legacy — Fitness Tracking App

Minimal starter README for the Fit Legacy project.

## What this is
A placeholder README and .gitignore to initialize the repository. Replace this with your project description and development instructions when ready.

## Files created
- `README.md` — this file
- `.gitignore` — common ignores for Node, Python, editors, and OS files

## Quick instructions (PowerShell)
Run the following in the project root to initialize git and push the first commit to GitHub. Replace the remote URL with your SSH URL if preferred.

```powershell
# initialize git, add files and commit
git init
git add README.md .gitignore
git commit -m "chore: initial commit"

# set main branch and add remote (replace URL if you use SSH)
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/DarioDagostino/Fit-Legacy-Fitness-Tracking-App.git

git push -u origin main
```

If you already have files to add, include them with `git add .` before committing.

## Next suggestions
- Add a short project description and development setup steps (dependencies, run commands).
- If this is a Node/React project, create `package.json` next with `npm init` and add a basic `README` section about scripts.
- Consider adding a LICENSE file when you decide on a license.
