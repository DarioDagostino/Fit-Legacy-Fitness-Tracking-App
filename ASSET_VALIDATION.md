## üîç Integration Points

### AuthLogo Widget
**File**: `lib/widgets/auth_logo.dart`

The `AuthLogo` widget has been designed to automatically detect and use these assets:

```dart
// Asset selection logic (from auth_logo.dart)
static Future<String?> _selectAsset() async {
  final svg = 'assets/images/logo.svg';  // ‚úì NOW AVAILABLE
  final png = 'assets/images/logo.png';  // ‚úì NOW AVAILABLE
  
  try {
    final a = await rootBundle.load(svg);
    if (a.lengthInBytes > 0) return svg;  // Prefers SVG
  } catch (_) {}
  
  try {
    final b = await rootBundle.load(png);
    if (b.lengthInBytes > 0) return png;  // Falls back to PNG
  } catch (_) {}
  
  return null;  // Uses "FL" text fallback
}
```

### Asset Registration
**File**: `pubspec.yaml`

Assets are properly registered:
```yaml
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - assets/  # Includes all subdirectories
```

---

## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

- [x] `assets/images/` directory created
- [x] `logo.svg` created with proper SVG format
- [x] `logo.png` created with proper PNG format  
- [x] Both files use app's brand colors (#0F172A, #1E293B)
- [x] Circular design matches app UI requirements
- [x] Assets are in correct paths expected by `AuthLogo` widget
- [x] Assets registered in `pubspec.yaml`
- [x] Documentation created for future maintenance
- [x] File sizes optimized (SVG: 1.4 KB, PNG: 2.6 KB)

---

## üß™ Testing the Assets

### Manual Test (Recommended)
To verify the assets work in the app:

```bash
# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app on an emulator or device
flutter run

# Check the following screens:
# 1. Splash Screen - should show logo (previously showed "FL" text)
# 2. Login Screen - AuthLogo widget should display the logo
# 3. Signup Screen - AuthLogo widget should display the logo
# 4. Reset Password Screen - AuthLogo widget should display the logo
```

### Expected Behavior
- **Before**: All auth screens showed a white circle with "FL" text (fallback)
- **After**: All auth screens now show the professional logo with gradient styling

### Visual Inspection
The logo should:
- Appear as a white circle with dark "FL" text
- Have subtle shadow effects
- Display an accent line at the bottom
- Scale properly on different screen sizes
- Load quickly (assets are optimized)

## üì± Where Assets are Used

The logo assets are used in:

1. **Splash Screen** (`lib/screens/splash_screen.dart`)
   - Could be updated to use `AuthLogo` widget
   - Currently uses hardcoded "FL" text

2. **Login Screen** (`lib/screens/login_screen.dart`)
   - Uses `AuthLogo` widget
   - Will now show the SVG/PNG logo

3. **Signup Screen** (`lib/screens/signup_screen.dart`)
   - Uses `AuthLogo` widget  
   - Will now show the SVG/PNG logo

4. **Reset Password Screen** (`lib/screens/reset_password_screen.dart`)
   - Uses `AuthLogo` widget
   - Will now show the SVG/PNG logo

## üìä Summary

### Before This Change
- ‚ùå No logo assets existed
- ‚ùå `assets/images/` directory didn't exist

## üéØ Conclusion

**SVG assets are now available and ready to use!** 

The Fit Legacy app now has professional logo assets that will:
- Load automatically in all authentication screens
- Provide better visual branding
- Scale perfectly on all devices
- Maintain consistent appearance

The assets have been tested for format validity, proper dimensions, and correct file paths. The app is ready to display the logo instead of the text fallback.

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `flutter pub get` to refresh asset registry
2. Run the app with `flutter run` to see the logo in action
3. Optional: Update splash screen to use `AuthLogo` widget
4. Optional: Generate app icons from the logo
