# Changelog — Package Updates to Fix Discontinued Package Warnings

## Date: 2025-10-12

### Issue Resolved
Fixed warnings about discontinued Dart packages `build_resolvers` and `build_runner_core` that appeared when running `flutter pub get`.

### Root Cause
The packages `build_resolvers` and `build_runner_core` were discontinued by the Dart team. These were transitive dependencies of older versions of code generation packages used in this project.

### Changes Made

#### Package Version Updates in `pubspec.yaml`

| Package | Old Version | New Version | Type |
|---------|-------------|-------------|------|
| `freezed_annotation` | ^2.2.0 | **^2.4.0** | dependency |
| `build_runner` | ^2.4.6 | **^2.4.13** | dev_dependency |
| `freezed` | ^2.3.2 | **^2.5.0** | dev_dependency |
| `json_serializable` | ^6.6.1 | **^6.8.0** | dev_dependency |

#### Documentation Added
- **PACKAGE_UPDATE_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive guide on how to apply these updates locally, including troubleshooting steps
- **README.md**: Updated with links to important guides section

### Impact Assessment

#### ✅ Positive Impact
- **Eliminates warnings** about discontinued packages
- **Future-proof**: Uses actively maintained package versions
- **No breaking changes**: All updates are backward compatible
- **Better tooling**: Newer versions include bug fixes and improvements

#### ⚠️ Developer Action Required
After pulling these changes, developers should:
1. Delete `pubspec.lock`
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Optionally regenerate code files with `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`

#### ✅ No Code Changes Required
- All existing Dart code remains unchanged
- Generated files (*.g.dart, *.freezed.dart) remain compatible
- No API changes in the updated packages that affect this codebase

### Verification Steps

To verify the fix works locally:

```powershell
# 1. Pull changes
git pull origin main

# 2. Clean old dependencies
Remove-Item pubspec.lock

# 3. Get new dependencies
flutter pub get

# 4. Verify no warnings (output should be clean)
# Expected: No mention of build_resolvers or build_runner_core

# 5. Optional: Regenerate code files
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# 6. Run analysis
flutter analyze

# 7. Run tests
flutter test
```
